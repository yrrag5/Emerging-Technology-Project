This project covers the contents of the module Emerging Technology. We were tasked to create jupyter notebooks through Anaconda on the topics:

  Numpy random package(1-Numpy : numpy-random.ipynb)
  
  Iris Data Set(2-Iris : Iris-Dataset.ipynb)
  
  MNIST Data Set (3-Mnist : MNIST-Dataset.ipynb)
  
  Digit Recognition(4-Digit-Recognition.ipynb, digitrec.py)
  
 
 # Anaconda
 
 Before running the notebooks you must first install anaconda onto your machine here: hhttps://www.anaconda.com/download/ Select pyhton 3.6 which will automatically come with pyhton version 3.6.7 as well as jupyter notebook. You may need to install tensorflow from enviroments in anaconda navigator for the digit recognition notebook and script.
 
 # Git clone and running notebooks
 
 Clone the url to a directory of your choice by running this command in the command line - git clone https://github.com/yrrag5/Emerging-Technology-Project.git
 
 With that achieved you will just need to run - (jupyter notebook) in this directory in the command line to access these notebooks through your default browser.
